## Implementation Plan

### Approach
[I started with the Displaying the Merchants in the List View, adding filters and search functionalities. After creating the UI components, I created the API required to the specific feature and then connected the APIs to the frontend using the provided api service.]

### Order of Implementation
1. [First task/feature - e.g., "Merchant List View - table display and API integration"]
2. [Second task/feature]
3. [Third task/feature]
...

### Technical Decisions
[Note any important technical decisions - e.g., "Will use React Query for data fetching", "Will use Recharts for charts"]

### Assumptions
[List any assumptions - e.g., "Assuming backend API endpoints will return data in specified format"]

### Timeline
- [ ] Task selection: [Date/Time]
- [ ] Start implementation: [Date/Time]
- [ ] Target completion: [Date/Time]
